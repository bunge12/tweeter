# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone application. It allows users to post tweets to the server without the need to reload the page, as well as to view the "feed" of all tweets.

**BEWARE**: This app was published for learning purposes and it is not intended for use in production-grade software.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Final Product

- Node, Express, MongoDB in the back-end
- HTML, AJAX, jQuery, and JavaScript for front-end functionality
- Responsive CSS with Flexbox
- Create tweets by clicking the "Write tweet" button which reveals a hidden compose box
- Don't lose focus with tweet highlights for tweets that are in focus
- Easily scroll back to the top of the site with a convenient "Scroll to top" button
